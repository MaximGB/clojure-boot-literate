* Clojure/ClojureScript/Boot literate programing project template for Emacs + Org mode

  This is a skeleton of a Literate Clojure/Boot project in Emacs/Org envirenoment. It shows how to shape a literate 
  programming project from several org-files, and no just one, and still have proper documentation and code export
  (tangling) both from Emacs directly as well as from project generated shell-scripts.
  
  The project is self-documenting, get started from ~project.org~ and it should be more or less clear how to use it,
  or navigate to [[https://maximgb.github.io/clojure-boot-literate/][pre-exported documentation]].
